<p>
    His lean frame, simple manner and unassuming nature belie
    a maturity way beyond his age and a sharp mind full of great 
    focus and determination. Despite having faced many difficulties in life, 
    his resolve and ambition to do something meaningful for society is inspirational.
    He himself is inspired by Albert Einstein and Swami Vivekanand. Rahul Biswash,
    third year student of Electronics and Communication Engineering of our School
    of Engineering is currently off to University of Arkansas on a fully paid 
    scholarship, working on a special research project. Lucky dude, many would say! 
    Well, think again. Rahul, our â€˜Outstanding Student Achieverâ€™ this month has 
    faced many an adversity and is the perfect example of fighting all odds to achieve
    something big and unbelievable. This is a story that just may give you goose bumps!
